Welcome to my personal website! Currently I‚Äôm [pursuing a PhD](https://www.uu.nl/medewerkers/AJHzuijderwijk) at the Department of Information and Computing Sciences of Utrecht University. My research is centered around the use of information technology to further an [open government](https://www.open-overheid.nl/) and is funded by the [Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management](https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/ministeries/ministerie-van-infrastructuur-en-waterstaat).

There are many things that have my interest! I particularly like electronics, building software, playing music (mainly the piano), graphic design, self-hosting stuff and watching bad movies. Primarily, this site was made to store (and share) my thoughts on topics that are interesting to me.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note that this website is still a work in progress! I'm still transfering posts and features from my old [blog](https://old.joszuijderwijk.nl/blog) to this site.
